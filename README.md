## Implement a System with Data and Application Layers

For this assessment I have chosen to implement an Instagram-like app with and update to add some revolutionary new features. Users are now able to create posts that don't necessarily have to have some form of media such as a photo or video attached! Plain text is perfectly acceptable, and images can still be added to a post after if the user wishes to. 

The next feature which was added was to give users the ability to either like OR dislike a post! This new feature may also be used in the future to gather data and develop better algorithms to show users content that they really want to see.
